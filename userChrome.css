 * Pick whichever variant you like, it doesn't have to match your GNOME version,
 * but it will probably look better if it does. Remember that your GTK theme
 * variant must match the variant you pick here, eg. if you pick a light
 * variant, you must also run Firefox using the light variant by either
 * disabling global dark theme in GNOME Tweak Tool or running Firefox explicity
 * with the light theme:
 *   $ GTK_THEME=Adwaita:light firefox
 * The opposite applies to the dark variant, you must either enable global dark
 * theme or run Firefox like this:
 *   $ GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark firefox
